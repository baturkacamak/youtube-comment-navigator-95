## 🧑‍💻 Development Guide

### Setting Up

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start Development Server (with Hot Module Replacement):**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    - This starts Vite in watch mode.
    - Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser.
    - Enable **Developer mode**.
    - Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist` folder in this project.
    - Any changes you make to `src/` will instantly update in the browser.

3.  **Build for Production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    # OR
    just package
    ```

    - Creates an optimized build in the `dist/` folder.
    - `just package` will creates a generic zip file for distribution.

4.  **Run Tests:**

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

    - Runs the test suite using Vitest.

### Available Scripts

- **dev**: `vite` - Starts the development server with HMR.
- **build**: `tsc && vite build && npm run build:css` - Type-checks and builds the production version.
- **preview**: `vite preview` - Preview the build locally.
- **test**: `vitest` - Runs unit tests.
- **test:ui**: `vitest --ui` - Runs tests with a UI interface.
- **build:css**: Converts `rem` units to `em` in the build output for better scaling within the extension.
- **build:css:rtl**: Generates RTL CSS support.

### Release Workflow

We use `just` to simplify release tasks:

- **Update Version:**

  ```bash
  just bump        # Interactive menu
  just bump 1.8.2  # Direct update
  ```

  Updates `package.json` and `manifest.json`, creates a git commit and tag.

- **Package Extension:**
  ```bash
  just package
  ```
  Builds the project and creates a zip file (e.g., `youtube-comment-navigator-95_v1.8.2.zip`).
